# AstroHaskell
A collection of astrodynamical routines for Haskell. Check out the following:
* AccretionDisk.hs: Build a razor thin rotating disc of particles. These are in general not stable.
* Elements.hs: Convert positions and velocities to orbital elements and back.
* Kepler.hs: Solve Kepler's equation, also in the general form, which works with all types of orbits (circular, elliptic, parabolic).
* Leapfrog.hs: Showcases how Haskell's functional syntax shines in constructing leapfrog-type iterated integrators.
* PostNewtonian.hs: For computing relativistic Post-Newtonian corrections to two-body motion.
* Stumpff.hs: Implementation of Stumpff's c and G functions, used in the general formulation of Kepler's equation.
